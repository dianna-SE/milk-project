# MILK | MESSAGING WEBSITE

## Getting Started

MILK is a messaging website that allows users to log in, send messages, emojis and add new channels to message in. This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and React framework, along with Redux library to maintain the application and NodeJS for user login authentication. Please note that development for the website is not fully completed. Responsive web design media queries will be implemented in future development.

Users must login to the website using a gmail account in order to gain access to the messaging website. 

## Reponsibilities:
• Wrote a messaging application using React and Redux to implement architecture design while maintaining an efficient application data flow by 20%.

• Utilized React to handle user input, display chat logs, and send messages and emojis that maintained component reusability and quick reloading response.

• Used JavaScript to establish a dynamic client-sided architecture that reduced server-side workload and increased responsiveness.

## Working: 
Log in user authentification, messages, chat box, sidebar channels, add channels, emoji library, send messages.

## In development: 
Search bar, media queries, delete channels, upload images, online user list.
